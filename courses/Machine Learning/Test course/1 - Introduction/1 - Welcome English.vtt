Hey, guys, welcome to this course.

00:02.670 --> 00:08.010
Together, we're going to master in-depth concepts and deep learning and apply our knowledge to solve

00:08.010 --> 00:08.970
real world problems.

00:08.970 --> 00:15.990
Using the Python programming language and Google's TensorFlow to what you'll learn in this course will

00:15.990 --> 00:22.260
not only lay a solid foundation in your deep learning career, but also permit you to be a world class

00:22.260 --> 00:22.920
professional.

00:23.580 --> 00:29.370
If you've gotten to this point, it means you're interested in my sense of learning and using your skills

00:29.370 --> 00:31.290
to solve practical problems.

00:32.130 --> 00:35.040
You may already have some knowledge on machine learning and deep learning.

00:35.550 --> 00:39.300
You may be coming in contact with deep learning for the very first time.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.460
It doesn't matter from which.

00:41.460 --> 00:47.760
And you come from, because at the end of this course you shall be an expert with much hands on experience.

00:48.450 --> 00:54.660
You shall build several projects in domains like computer vision, speech processing and natural language

00:54.660 --> 01:00.000
processing, using knowledge gained from this course, if you will, into movies that follow following

01:00.000 --> 01:00.690
your career.

01:01.080 --> 01:06.600
This causes does it for you, and we are super excited to help you achieve your goals.

01:07.290 --> 01:15.600
This course offered to you by neural learn or AI and just like every other cast by Nail and I will lay

01:15.600 --> 01:22.020
much emphasis on feedback, your views and questions and the forum will help us better this course.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.710
Feel free to access as many questions as possible on the forum.

01:26.610 --> 01:29.610
We do our very best to reply in the shortest possible time.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.260
Let's get started.
