00:00.180 --> 00:03.810
Deep learning could be applied in several industries.

00:04.560 --> 00:12.120
One of those industries is the automobile industry, and today we have self-driving cars.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.480
Thanks to the deep learning techniques.

00:16.170 --> 00:22.680
Yeah, this image shows exactly what a Tesla self-driving car sees.

00:23.370 --> 00:33.210
We see how this car, which is driverless, is able to understand its environment visually and take

00:33.210 --> 00:34.290
the right decisions.

00:36.150 --> 00:43.740
This means that this car, for example, is able to detect traffic lights and not only detect this traffic

00:43.740 --> 00:46.830
lights, but get their current state.

00:47.400 --> 00:54.720
So it means if we have a traffic light on the road, it will be able to use the images coming from the

00:54.720 --> 01:02.760
camera, which has been stored in the car to know where to pass, to stop or to get ready to move.

01:03.510 --> 01:10.920
These are really great advancements, but it is important to note that we are pretty far from the human

01:10.920 --> 01:17.580
level kind of intelligence still in the automobile industry and manufacturing in general.

01:17.940 --> 01:28.950
We see how the startup learning A.I. is using deep learning to automatically detect defects in parts

01:28.950 --> 01:30.150
which have been produced.

01:31.290 --> 01:37.980
And so companies using this kind of products can gain in time and resources as now this kind of defect

01:37.980 --> 01:39.000
detection could be done.

01:40.110 --> 01:40.440
Yeah.

01:40.440 --> 01:46.290
Again, we're seeing how this robots are automatically working in this assembly unit.

01:46.860 --> 01:57.030
And apart from this kind of applications, A.I. could be used in coming up with very efficient energy

01:57.030 --> 01:58.620
systems for cars.

01:59.040 --> 02:03.690
The next domain in which we could apply deep learning is indeed a generation.

02:04.500 --> 02:10.860
Now, when you look at this image of these different images, what may come to your mind is you have

02:10.860 --> 02:11.670
this image.

02:11.910 --> 02:18.930
And then this is like a caption we read a man patting a small dog and smiling for a camera.

02:19.380 --> 02:23.040
Yeah, we have a man in a business suit sitting in front of paper work.

02:23.790 --> 02:29.160
But what's interesting to note here is that actually these are not real images.

02:29.580 --> 02:30.840
Those images, right?

02:30.840 --> 02:31.080
Yeah.

02:31.080 --> 02:39.930
Were generated just by a neural network which was fed with this input sentences.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.150
So the input, yeah.

02:42.150 --> 02:45.390
For example, was there are a lot of people that are on the beach.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.220
And so this was generated in the entertainment industry.

02:51.030 --> 02:54.870
Artificial intelligence is used for recommender systems.

02:56.100 --> 03:02.970
If we take, for example, this video from YouTube, if I'm to watch this video or if you watch this

03:02.970 --> 03:09.630
video on YouTube, you will notice that after a while, YouTube tends to recommend to you videos which

03:09.630 --> 03:14.940
are related to what you've watched previously, and this is done automatically.

03:15.610 --> 03:17.010
Based on this.

03:17.010 --> 03:22.260
We see again another application which is the automatic generation of this subtitles.

03:22.650 --> 03:31.950
This is actually speech recognition of speech transcription as when neural learn upload this video on

03:31.950 --> 03:32.430
YouTube.

03:33.060 --> 03:40.650
We don't actually upload those videos with the subtitles, but YouTube automatically generates this

03:40.830 --> 03:43.740
by just getting the sound from the video.

03:44.850 --> 03:52.950
And this has a very great application for people with auditory problems still in the media entertainment

03:52.950 --> 03:53.670
industry.

03:54.210 --> 04:03.470
We have the image captioning in which when given an input image, the machine is able to understand

04:03.480 --> 04:06.690
an image and produce this kind of output.

04:07.230 --> 04:14.880
So we have, for example, a group of young people playing a game of Frisbee, two dogs playing the

04:14.880 --> 04:18.420
grass, and all the examples we see here.

04:20.530 --> 04:24.760
A clear example of how this is using is in Google photos.

04:25.810 --> 04:30.730
Once you take photos, what goes on in the background is that this.

04:32.110 --> 04:35.960
Kind of made that data is been starved of that image.

04:37.360 --> 04:44.500
And so later on, if you search for see dark images, you know, phone or the photos, this photo is

04:44.500 --> 04:45.220
going to pop up.

04:46.420 --> 04:56.710
And that's because an AI algorithm has initially generated this kind of output metadata on which now

04:56.710 --> 05:02.080
could be used subsequently to search for information which is stored in this image.

05:03.010 --> 05:06.790
We also have object detection, which is a very popular application of deep learning.

05:07.180 --> 05:15.580
Yeah, we see clearly how this we have this input image and the algorithm is able to detect all, first

05:15.580 --> 05:24.010
of all correctly see that there's a car, trunk person, umbrella car and all of this in this image.

05:24.280 --> 05:30.910
And not only doing that, but look at exactly where this different objects are found in the image.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.980
Another very useful application of deep learning is in the health care industry.

05:36.730 --> 05:43.120
Yeah, we'll see how it could be used in detecting cancer, finding a breast tissue.

05:43.840 --> 05:50.400
And apart from breast cancer, several other that most of this could be done using deep learning.

05:51.250 --> 05:58.870
Still, in the healthcare industry, deep learning could be used in drug discovery and even in the building

05:58.870 --> 06:07.630
of wearables like glasses, which help visually impaired people to better perceive the environment.

06:07.960 --> 06:15.310
It should also be noted that in such detection systems, the A.I. could be built to help medical practitioners.

06:17.140 --> 06:24.130
Not just by replacing them, but by actually assisting them in doing the job better and more efficiently

06:24.910 --> 06:25.930
in the music world.

06:26.470 --> 06:33.510
Yeah, it could be used in generation of music and even composition of music and in telecommunications.

06:33.550 --> 06:41.530
Just like with many other domains, we have virtual assistants which help companies respond to thousands

06:41.530 --> 06:50.260
of requests from clients without necessarily having employees to check on those requests.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.130
In banking and finance, yeah.

06:53.170 --> 07:02.800
It could be used in helping people do better investments by helping them their investment strategies.

07:03.280 --> 07:10.540
You could also be very important in fraud detection by monitoring the system on noticing anomalies.

07:11.320 --> 07:19.630
Apart from those domains, there are so many other domains in which deep learning could be applied and

07:19.630 --> 07:24.640
even some other domains in which deep learning has not yet been applied.

07:25.210 --> 07:34.480
And so we expect you to tap into potentials of deep learning by applying it in several different domains.

07:35.320 --> 07:42.160
It should also be noted that before applying deep learning in a given domain, you have to do a conscious

07:42.160 --> 07:51.640
effort to understand, firstly, how that domain works and better still work with domain experts so

07:51.640 --> 07:54.610
that you could come up with the best possible solutions.

07:55.360 --> 08:03.100
After finishing this course, you also have to be able to discuss with a domain expert who hasn't yet

08:03.220 --> 08:10.720
come in touch with deep learning and be able to understand clearly how the learning could be applied

08:10.720 --> 08:12.040
in that specific domain.

08:12.640 --> 08:18.850
But also be careful not to overuse deep learning, as there are many problems which could be solved

08:18.850 --> 08:26.140
with simple classical machine learning algorithms, which many times practitioners tend to use deep

08:26.140 --> 08:33.130
learning algorithms of which the simple classical machine learning algorithms would have been best fit

08:33.130 --> 08:36.250
and come up with even better results.

08:36.610 --> 08:43.300
Welcome to this very interesting and ever changing domain.
